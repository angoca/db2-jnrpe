{"name":"Db2-jnrpe","tagline":"Plugin to monitor DB2 with Nagios and JNRPE","body":"db2-jnrpe\r\n=========\r\n\r\n([Please check the Wiki](https://github.com/angoca/db2-jnrpe/wiki) for more information)\r\n\r\nThis is a set of plugins to monitor DB2 via Nagios. It relies on the JNRPE\r\nframework, which is a Java implementation of the NRPE server.\r\nThis framework is very flexible and it can be used not only to monitor DB2\r\ndatabase, but also to:\r\n\r\n* Create more plugins to monitor other elements of DB2.\r\n* Create plugins for other RDBMS using the benefits of Java.\r\n\r\nThe difference between this set of plugins and other available in the market is\r\nthat a Java daemon allows to reduce the overhead on the database.\r\nOther scripts, establishes one or multiple connections to query the elements in\r\nthe database each time they are executed, and this creates a big overhead in\r\nthe database.\r\nThis set of plugins keeps the connection active thanks to a connection pool\r\n(Hikari or C3p0) and this reduces the overhead of connection establishment.\r\n\r\nAlso, many plugins queries the same values to monitor similar elements.\r\nFor example, for each bufferpool, other plugins has to query the database\r\nseveral times to retrieve the same information and then filter it according to\r\nthe given parameters (different commands).\r\nThis set of plugins queries the database once, and keep the information in a\r\ncache to be used for multiple commands.\r\n\r\nWith a cache system, this plugin can compare values with the previous\r\nmeasures, in order to give an instant performance.\r\nNo extra files are required, just a daemon executing in a server.\r\n\r\nBecause the JNRPE is a pure Java application, it can be executed in any\r\nplatform, Linux/UNIX/MAC OS X or Windows. This is a very important difference\r\nwith the other plugins in the market that require bash on Linux, or Perl.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Plugins\r\n\r\nThis is the list of available DB2 plugins:\r\n\r\n* Check_Average_Sorting_Time: Checks the quantity of time expended in sorts per\r\nsorts.\r\n* Check_Bufferpool_Hit_Ratio: Allows to check the performance of the\r\nbufferpools, by measuring the hit ratio between the most recent measures.\r\n* Check_Database_Load: Checks the database load according to the quantity\r\nof modifications (UID: Update, insert, delete), commits and selects.\r\n* Check_Physical_IO_Per_Transaction: Measures the quantity of physical reads\r\nper transaction.\r\n* Check_Sorting_Time_Per_Transaction: Checks the quantity of sorts per\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Prerequisites\r\n\r\nIn order to run this set of plugins, it is necessary to have Java 6 or 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\nThe installation process consist in:\r\n\r\n* Download JNRPE and installed if it has not been done.\r\n* Download a stable release of this project from\r\n    https://github.com/angoca/db2-jnrpe/releases\r\n* Download the required libraries:\r\n * Hikari\r\n * JavaAssist\r\n* Copy the DB2 driver in the same directory.\r\n* Configure the jnrpe.ini file with the plugins.\r\n* Start the JNRPE server.\r\n* Configure Nagios to call the plugins.\r\n* Restart Nagios.\r\n\r\nA more detailed installation guide can be found in the wiki:\r\n  https://github.com/angoca/db2-jnrpe/wiki/Install\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n* Nagios - http://www.nagios.org/\r\n* JNRPE - http://www.jnrpe.it/\r\n* DB2 - http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
